# random-help

A random collection of iOS projects / playgrounds I've created while helping people, commonly on http://ios-developers.io/

May contain traces of projects where I needed help (such as ScrollEdgeAppearanceBug)

Almost none of these apps are complete. They're the bare minimum required to demonstrate/help the person asking questions.

You'll find the code is largely uncommented since it was broken down in Slack threads, providing explanation there where needed.
