# Connect the Dots

A simple game in UIKit.

Assisted the developer asking:
- how to generating a grid of randomly coloured circles in `UIStackView`s
- allowing the user to draw lines between identically coloured adjacent circles.
- having the lines "snap" to the centre of the origin circle, and any valid circle passed through

As with all the apps in this repo, it is only the bare minimum required to assist the person asking questions. In this case nothing happens once you've made lines/connections between dots, and the connections aren't persisted.
